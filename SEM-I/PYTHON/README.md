# Welcome to Directory : PYTHON

## This directory contains Python programs.

### How to execute the programs?

#### You have 2 options:
1. Either use normal [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to run the programs.

2. After downloading and installing any one of above python, next step is downloading jupyter notebook. You can download it from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

3. If you have downloaded only python and not anaconda then follow these steps to have jupyter.
    - Open command prompt and type `pip install jupyter` and hit enter.
    - After installation is complete, type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter.
    - It will open a new tab in your default browser.
    - If command prompt says `jupyter command not found` then you have to add python to your path. Follow [this](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/) to add python to path.
4. Hope this `readme.md` helps.
